<p><strong>Original Sidekick</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;m not typically an early gadget adopter, but I was so into the whole concept of the Sidekick I got one of the early ones. The good old black and white, nice fat ones. Surprisingly, I wasn&#8217;t disappointed.</p>

<p>I travel a lot, so having access to email while on the road was a great feature. The Sidekick is always connected, so no dial-up and waiting for connections. It&#8217;s just there. The data on the Sidekick is automatically backed to the Web. Create a new note, it&#8217;s automatically on the T-mobile site. Take a picture, it&#8217;s automatically on the Web. I can take notes on the Sidekick, and when I&#8217;m on the computer, I can simply access them through a Web browser. The device also has IM and Web browsing built in. Too many times I have read news headlines while stuck in traffic. Once I actually booked a ticket on Southwest while on the way to the airport via the Sidekick browser, which was silly but cool (I could&#8217;ve much more easily just dialed Southwest and booked it that way, but I&#8217;d have lost the double frequent flyer credit).</p>

<p>The cons for this thing are construction and reliability - I believe I had mine fixed or replaced three times, and still it was never quite right. It&#8217;s also a bit too bulky. It&#8217;s terrible as a phone - awkward to hold, and just generally too big. I used it strictly for data.</p>

<p><strong>And then came: Sidekick II</strong></p>

<p>My trusty black and white Sidekick eventually became crippled through lots of use and abuse, so I get the new <a href='/web/20120203002611/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=parandcom-20&amp;path=tg/detail/-/B00063DKVC/qid=1108109962/sr=52-1/ref=sr_52_1_etk-cell/?v=glance&amp;s=wireless&amp;n=301185'>Sidekick II</a>. I really like this device. It has all of the benefits and features of the original, but feels a lot more solid, is more compact, and is usable as a phone. The speakerphone sounds quite good. T-mobile is also finally offering an outlook synchronization capability for a one time $10 fee, which is well worth it for me.</p>

<p>I purchased this from Amazon for $175 list, with $200 rebates, making it -$25 in theory. $50 of the rebate is from T-Mobile, and requires you to be on a plan of $39 or above. The problem is, there&#8217;s also a $20 per month data access fee, costing you at least $50 per month total (if you take a $30/month voice plan). The alternative is to go with an unlimited data only plan, which costs you $30 per month. I decided to forego the $50 rebate and switched to the $30 unlimited data plan as soon as I got the phone. I have a separate phone, so for me this made sense.</p>

<p>In practice this worked out to $25 after rebate, plus $35 activation fee, plus $30/month.</p>
