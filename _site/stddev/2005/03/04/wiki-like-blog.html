<p>So I&#8217;ve started this blog. But before I commit any more of my precious thoughts into this medium, let me step back and be one with the blog. Let me complain.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m using <a href='/web/20120203061424/http://wordpress.org/'>WordPress</a>, which is really quite nice. But, â€¦</p>

<p>You see, my thoughts, if you hadn&#8217;t noticed, are not trifles to be tossed away with the wind, yesterday&#8217;s news, here today gone tomorrow. They&#8217;re timeless treasures, to be cherised for all time. For each topic, I&#8217;d like <strong>permanent pages with meaningful, static-looking URLs</strong>. That way I can go back and build on a topic I had approached before. Also, each post can get indexed by google and I can make a fortune selling ads.</p>

<p>From the <a href='/web/20120203061424/http://codex.wordpress.org/Pages'>Wordpress Wiki</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Posts are very time-oriented objects. You write them at a specific time, and that time defines their context. Pages, on the other hand, are most often used to present information about yourself or your site that is somehow timeless - information that is always applicable. For example, you might write a Post describing what you did or thought on a particular morning (&#8220;Breakfast was good&#8221;), but on a Page you might write something whose context is less time dependent (&#8220;This site is about breakfast&#8221;).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Hmm. I disagree. The information in my posts are always applicable. They are precious nuggets of pure gold, dammit! In any case, Pages don&#8217;t have static-looking URLs either (by static-looking, I mean yahoo/google index-able).</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve found some resources on this: <a href='/web/20120203061424/http://ferret.bemidjistate.edu/~morgan/cgi-bin/blogsandwiki.pl?WhenBlogMeetsWiki'>WhenBlogsMeetWiki</a>,<br /><a href='/web/20120203061424/http://ferret.bemidjistate.edu/~morgan/cgi-bin/blogsandwiki.pl?WikiAndBlog'>WikiAndBlog</a> .</p>

<p>I want the ease of use, the chronological presentation, the comment threading, and overall prettiness of a blog, but with the information publishing capabilities of a Wiki. I guess the main aspect of a Wiki is the communal editing capability; that&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m looking for in this context.</p>

<p>Basically, I want a blog front-end for a Wiki. Is that unreasonable?</p>
