<p>I bought a <a href='/web/20120203080910/http://www.parand.com/reviews/CreativeMuvoMp3.html'>Creative Nomad Muvo MP3 Player</a> a little while back. I love this thing; it&#8217;s exactly what I wanted.</p>

<p>Before buying that, I tried a Lexar MPC-231 JumpGear, which is basically a cap for a USB memory stick that turns it into an MP3 player. I wasn&#8217;t happy with it; there wasn&#8217;t enough control, the screen was too small, it just didn&#8217;t feel right. This was generally my opinion of the stick type MP3 players, although my brother has the same Lexar and is happy with it.</p>

<p>So along comes Apple. They have a player with <em>less</em> features, <em>less</em> control, <em>no screen</em>. This would be absolutely un-sellable for Creative. A non-starter for any other brand. Sell <em>less</em> for a higher price? No way.</p>

<p>But apple has the intelligence to understand with such limited storage space fancy controls don&#8217;t make sense, the guts to embrace that, and the marketing genius to take a <em>lack</em> of features and turn it into a positive. <strong>The Shuffle</strong>. It&#8217;s freakin&#8217; genius.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve worked with and ran into quite a few marketing people in my time. They spend most of their time explaining that their sales people are idiots, the customers are idiots, or both. Apparently they got it backwards. I&#8217;m convinced there are 4 people who actually can do marketing, and they all work at Apple.</p>
