<p>&#8220;What do you think about the whole SOAP vs. REST thing?&#8221;. I hate this question, but it comes up all the time. Who cares? It&#8217;s all just XML over HTTP*. I don&#8217;t care about SOAP vs. REST.</p>

<p>My traditional answer has been: REST is great for simpler projects where the verb vocabulary fits the limited HTTP set, but as you look to add capabilities, you&#8217;ll invariably invent an envelope, and then some way of describing your service, so why not use SOAP and WSDL.</p>

<p>But this is not working. I&#8217;ve been publicly advocating SOAP for a long time; in fact, in a past life I started a company in that space. So it&#8217;s not easy for me to say this, but SOAP is in deep trouble. And when I say SOAP, I mean the whole SOAP+WSDL+UDDI+WS-* bundle, since the term Web services is ambiguous and includes REST for some people.</p>

<p><strong>The problem is <a href='/web/20110106052927/http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/12/WSDM-Disapproval'>our obsession with constantly inventing new specifications</a> instead of pausing and fixing the existing ones based on real world feedback.</strong></p>

<p>To all you WS-* inventors out there: <a href='/web/20110106052927/http://norman.walsh.name/2005/02/24/wsdl'>Look</a>. Look people, <a href='/web/20110106052927/http://www.redmonk.com/jgovernor/archives/000474.html'>look</a>, <a href='/web/20110106052927/http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/11/WSInTheSpring'>look</a>, <a href='/web/20110106052927/http://developer.yahoo.net/faq/#soap'>look</a>, <a href='/web/20110106052927/http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=95113'>look</a>. Very smart people are having a lot of trouble with SOAP. Do you not see this as a problem? Do you see any of these problems being fixed by your new specification? Or should we pause for a minute, <strong>get the basics right, grow the whole market</strong>, and then address the higher level issues?</p>

<p>Let me point out the obvious: the whole Web has been built on simple little HTTP. How about that HTTP-DistributedManagement spec? How about that one about routing it through all kinds of actors and intermediaries? You hadn&#8217;t heard of those? It&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t exist.</p>

<p>This feels like dejva-vu; I <a href='/web/20110106052927/http://www.newarchitectmag.com/documents/s=7221/na0702j/index.html'>wrote about this in 2002</a>, and likely will again in the future. But let this be another data point: a hard-core, first-in-line SOAP guy is getting seriously turned off by this whole mess. REST is looking more attractive every day.</p>

<p>* Yes, I know SOAP is over &#8220;any&#8221; transport, but pragmatically speaking.</p>
