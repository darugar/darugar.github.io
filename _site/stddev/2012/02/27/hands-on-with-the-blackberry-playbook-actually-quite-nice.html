<p>Over the weekend I attended the Blackberry hackathon with the hopes of creating an <a href='/web/20120918052602/http://xpenser.com/'>Xpenser</a> blackberry app. The RIM folks were nice enough to give away a Playbook to everyone who presented, so I ended up with one.</p>

<p><img src='/web/20120918052602im_/http://static8.businessinsider.com/image/4ca106617f8b9a5354760400/blackberry-playbook.jpg' alt='Blackberry Playbook' /></p>

<p>I was skeptical, to say the least. I expected a sluggish, ugly interface with a dearth of applications.</p>

<p>What I got is quite nice. The blackberry has a very usable interface - it&#8217;s fast and responsive, and some of the gestures (eg. closing and switching apps) are the best I&#8217;ve seen on a tablet.</p>

<p>It comes with a nice car racing game (I surprised myself by spending a few hours playing it), and the browser is quite excellent, probably the best I&#8217;ve seen on a tablet.</p>

<p>The development environment is also rich: you can use HTML or flash as well as native SDKs.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to come with a built-in email app (or if it does I&#8217;ve missed it), which is very surprising given the Blackberry pedigree.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s also lacking apps and games - the app world feels a bit empty.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m surprised at how much I like the device. I just wish it had more apps.</p>
