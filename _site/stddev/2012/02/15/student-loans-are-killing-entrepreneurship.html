<p>If you know me you know I&#8217;m a huge fan of entrepreneurship - instead of renting yourself out to someone else, start a business that scales. Be your own pimp.</p>

<p>I gave a guest lecture at UCSD recently espousing this viewpoint. You are cheap right now, I told them, so take advantage. If you wait 10 years to start a company you&#8217;ll have much higher earning power and much higher personal costs (spouse, mortgage, â€¦) and therefore a much higher opportunity cost when starting a company.</p>

<p><strong>What about our student loans?</strong> asked one of the students.</p>

<p>Good question. I don&#8217;t have a good answer.</p>

<p>When I went to school I was able to pay my way from the third year onward. I left school with savings instead of debt. I was able to start a company immediately.</p>

<p>Today students graduate with an average debt of about $27,000 dollars.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s just awful. That means they are bound to a job for at least the first part of their career. We&#8217;re removing the option of starting a company, of producing explosive value, of growing the economy to the benefit of the whole country, for more than 60% of our graduates.</p>

<p>Think of all of the companies with billions in value created by college students. Think Facebook, Dropbox. We need these. We want these created in the US.</p>

<p>We have to get education costs under control. We can screw the young generation over to put a few extra bucks in our pockets now, but we&#8217;ll all end up paying for it when we fall behind other countries who encourage their creative young to be entrepreneurs.</p>
