<p>I&#8217;ve been interested in <a href='/web/20101222035742/http://dabbledb.com/'>DabbleDB</a> for some time now, since they first showed up on the scene with their <a href='/web/20101222035742/http://dabbledb.com/explore/7minutedemo/'>Under The Radar</a> demo. I immediately pointed a friend at them, who in turn got very excited and spent a few days integrating his app with theirs, only to give up as he hit scaling issues on the DabbleDB side (his data set was too large).</p>

<p>I took another look, prompted by <a href='/web/20101222035742/http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/screenroom/dabble_flv.html'>Jon Udell&#8217;s latest screencast</a> (via <a href='/web/20101222035742/http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2006/11/01/jon_udell_visit.html'>Kedrosky</a>), and I understand better what they&#8217;re going after. Seems they&#8217;re targeting small business, where DabbleDB is used as a stand-alone app, very much as Excel on the Web with sharing built in.</p>

<p>I could see that working for them, although the install base and more importantly experience base around Excel is a tough nut to crack. And then there is <a href='/web/20101222035742/http://docs.google.com/'>Google Docs</a> of course, which is not nearly as rich of an experience, but if the use case is excel-on-the-web-with-sharing, it may be good enough.</p>

<p>But for me the more interesting side is being able to &#8220;mash up&#8221; DabbleDB into my own app. I have several side projects where having a nice tabular view that could explode out into the rich experience that Dabble offers would be fantastic. You&#8217;re using my Web app, you come to a nice innocent looking table, you click on it, and you have all the power of Dabble underneath. I love the idea of being able to build multiple views in DabbleDB and offer them as pages in my app - I&#8217;d get a much richer experience in my app without having to build the backend and the UI for the data parts.</p>

<p>However, as it stands the UI is not easily transplantable into my app. The data is offered out in reasonable ways, via an API and RSS, but I already have the data. I&#8217;m interested in DabbleDB the app. I don&#8217;t think I can host my apps on Dabble, nor can I integrate the Dabble interface into into my app.</p>

<p>DabbleDB could be my online database in a cloud. I can interact with my data via APIs, which is very nice. However, given that Dabble is a startup, do I really want to trust them with my data?</p>

<p>Funny how that works - with <a href='/web/20101222035742/http://www.amazon.com/S3-AWS-home-page-Money/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2/102-0987217-3863349?ie=UTF8&amp;node=16427261&amp;no=3435361&amp;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA'>Amazon&#8217;s S3</a> I have the opposite reaction. I&#8217;d like to back up all my data to it, because being in Amazon&#8217;s data center gives me a feeling of security. There&#8217;s also Google Base, but Google is starting to creep me out with their data policies and their <a href='/web/20101222035742/http://www.parand.com/say/index.php/2005/12/13/adsense-login-nonsense/'>customer support</a> (disclosure: I work at Yahoo!, but they started creeping me out before I started a Yahoo!).</p>

<p>So let&#8217;s forget mashups and go back to the shared-online-excel use case. Recently I was exchanging data with the business folks and ran into a dataset that would be nicely served by DabbleDB: the query and report capabilities would be very useful, as would online collaboration. But I don&#8217;t think that would work either: I seriously doubt corporate policy would allow me to host confidential data on external servers. I realize there&#8217;s plenty of data in the world that doesn&#8217;t need to be secured, but that excludes pretty much all business / corporate data in any reasonably sized company.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m just not the target audience for DabbleDB at the moment. But I&#8217;d like to be. I like the app and I like the idea. I&#8217;d like to find a way to use it.</p>

<p>Have you had experience with DabbleDB or other hosted apps? What do you think?</p>
