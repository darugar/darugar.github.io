<blockquote>
<p>The Rev. Ted Haggard admitted Friday he bought methamphetamine from a male prostitute but maintained he never had sex with the man and never used the drug.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p>I bought it for myself but never used it. I was tempted but I never used it,&#8221; he said, smiling constantly from the driver&#8217;s seat of his pickup truck as he answered questions from reporters outside his home.</p>

<p>Jones [the male prostitute] said his acquaintance with Haggard - whom he knew as &#8220;Art&#8221; - lasted about three years, with Haggard calling him every month or so and paying him for sex. Haggard&#8217;s middle name is Arthur.</p>

<p>Jones said he learned Haggard&#8217;s real name about six months ago while watching a History Channel program on which Haggard was interviewed. Jones began researching Haggard and discovered his church&#8217;s positions on same-sex marriage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I got to tell you, I started getting pissed,&#8221; he said.</p>
