<p>As I was moderating the 37 pieces of comment spam I received this morning (must&#8217;ve been a hiccup in <a href='/web/20101222040836/http://akismet.com/'>Akismet</a>) I was struck by how much the activity resembles reading RSS feeds. Quick scan of the contents, followed by an action. Not to mention the abundance of junk in both cases <img src='/web/20101222040836im_/http://parand.com/say/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' /></p>

<p>It also struck me that the Google Reader interface would be perfect for this. By now I&#8217;m so used to the <a href='/web/20101222040836/http://scobleizer.com/2006/11/30/i-love-reading-feeds/'>J, J, K dance</a> of Google Reader that I find myself instinctively reaching for it everywhere.</p>

<p>Google Reader has great usability. It doesn&#8217;t require mouse movement, centers the content in the same location so you don&#8217;t have to move your focus, and gets everything accomplished with a few keystrokes. <a href='/web/20101222040836/http://reader.google.com/'>Try it</a> to see what I mean. Nice job Google Reader team.</p>

<p>This is an interface worth stealing. I&#8217;d like to see it used in a lot more places. Anytime you have lots of items to review or take action on and the actions are fairly limited and repetitive, this is a good interface.</p>

<p>I have a side project I might attempt to steal this on, but I want all of you to do the same. Spread the usability goodness. AJAX toolkit writers, include this as a pre-baked widget so we can get it going everywhere.</p>
