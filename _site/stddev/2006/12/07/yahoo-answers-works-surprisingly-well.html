<p>I tried <a href='/web/20101222042556/http://answers.yahoo.com/'>Yahoo Answers</a> when it first came out (I&#8217;m a Yahoo employee so I got a sneak preview). Interesting concept, I thought, let&#8217;s see how it turns out.</p>

<p>I checked it out every once in a while and wasn&#8217;t impressed - the questions are generally junk and the answers aren&#8217;t much better.</p>

<p>Tonight I was trying to figure out <a href='/web/20101222042556/http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajf206Pzz90ROGwXLY0RPWjsy6IX?qid=20061207171401AAL6WKb'>what kind of game console I should buy for the boys</a> (since the Wii is sold out everywhere). I don&#8217;t know much about game consoles so I sent email to friends and family for advice.</p>

<p>Then it occurred to me to try out the question on Yahoo Answers. The results were surprising. Within 30 minutes I had received 9 answers, 7 of which are actually helpful.</p>

<p>Since that worked so well I decided to ask another question that came to mind about <a href='/web/20101222042556/http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjiEubHR0OpAA7t84Yrj4.jsy6IX?qid=20061207173846AAzMP4s'>chemistry and physics experiments that can be done with household items</a>. That one is also generating interesting answers.</p>

<p>And now that I&#8217;ve received value from the community, I feel like I should give back and answer somebody else&#8217;s question.</p>

<p>Interesting system. Particularly impressive is how fast you get feedback - the first 6 answers came within 10 minutes of posting the question. The speed makes a real difference in the user experience.</p>

<p>One obvious improvement would be to put a link to questions you&#8217;ve asked somewhere more accessible - it&#8217;s a pain to find your questions right now.</p>
