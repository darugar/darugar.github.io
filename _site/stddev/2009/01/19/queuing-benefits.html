<p>Queues are nice things. We should be using more of them.</p>

<p>A couple of benefits that I knew of but didn&#8217;t really appreciate until Alex started using beanstalkd in his application:</p>

<p>- Having a worker-pulls-jobs-from-queue model provides near optimal use of the machine and prevents overload and thrashing. Setup as many simultaneous workers as your resources can handle and let them go. You have a controlled number of workers, preventing thrashing, and your workers work continuously. You don&#8217;t have to worry about a load distribution strategy - workers pull jobs as fast as they can.</p>

<p>- Provisioning new workers into the system becomes trivial. Want to add another box into the mix? Just set it up and have the workers start pulling jobs. You don&#8217;t have to worry about registering the new box and getting it into the load distribution system - so long as it knows how to connect to the queue it can grab jobs. Alex commented that scaling his system is as easy as bringing up another virtual machine - as soon as it&#8217;s up it starts pulling jobs.</p>

<p>These are both very important operational benefits that I had largely ignored.</p>
