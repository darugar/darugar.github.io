<p>Wikihow&#8217;s <a href='/web/20090201172627/http://www.wikihow.com/Stop-Accumulating-Books'>How To Stop Accumulating Books</a> has been making the rounds in blogs and delicious popular. Reminds me of the ultimate book non-accumulator, a good friend of my dad&#8217;s.</p>

<p>This particular friend of my dad&#8217;s would always bring me books when he came to visit. I was a voracious reader, to the point where people made fun of me for it, so I always loved his visits. And he brought interesting books - not children&#8217;s books, but histories, etc. I think he brought me Animal Farm when I was 8 or 9.</p>

<p>As I got older I started to notice something odd about the books - they didn&#8217;t belong to him.</p>

<p>Eventually I found out he didn&#8217;t own any books. He&#8217;d take a book from you, read it, and give it to someone else. Usually without permission.</p>

<p>I was fascinated. I remember asking him about it, and he told me: books cannot be owned. Ideas are the ultimate expression of freedom, and to cage them is unnatural. Books are for reading and for passing on.</p>

<p>That made a big impression on me. I&#8217;ve always thought sharing books with friends is the most amazing gift.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve never returned that book you lent me <img src='/web/20090201172627im_/http://parand.com/say/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' /></p>
