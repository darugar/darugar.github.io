<p>I used to be a vi guy who finally made the move to graphical editors. I looked for the simplest, lightest possible solutions, using <a href='/web/20101222042304/http://www.contexteditor.org/'>ConTEXT</a> for quite a while.</p>

<p>Some years ago I was forced into using Eclipse for reasons I can&#8217;t quite recall; probably Java development. I didn&#8217;t like it - the forced Project concept, the bloat, the general slowness.</p>

<p>Eventually I got comfortable with it, got <a href='/web/20101222042304/http://pydev.org/'>PyDev</a> installed, and made it my primary development environment. These days most of my development lives in Eclipse.</p>

<p><img src='/web/20101222042304im_/http://pydev.org/images/pydev_banner2.gif' alt='' /></p>

<p>With the 1.5 release PyDev included quite a few previously pay-only features in the free / open source version. Since then I&#8217;ve found I&#8217;ve become even more productive in the environment, and now actually enjoy it.</p>

<p>In particular, the code analysis is very useful. I love the fact that it points out unused imports and variables as well as syntax errors. Going through old code I was surprised at how many spurious imports I had, as well as a few actual errors in code that had been in production for several years in rarely exercised branches.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re doing python development I recommend you take a look at Eclipse+PyDev. I was surprised at the level of increased productivity it brought me.</p>
