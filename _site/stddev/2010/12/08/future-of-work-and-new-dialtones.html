<p>My friend <a href='/web/20101213011206/http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2010/12/the_future_of_w.html'>Paul Kedrosky&#8217;s post on one of his main investment theses</a>, the application of currently consumer oriented technologies to business (DropBox, Twitter, FaceBook, Yelp, â€¦), got me thinking about how the future of work will look.</p>

<p><img src='/web/20101213011206im_/http://parand.com/say/misc/retro-phone.jpg' alt='' /></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve made a career of working far from where I live. I&#8217;ve generally considered this a significant pain - there are disadvantages and inefficiencies in being geographically separated from coworkers. Hence I&#8217;ve endured horrible commutes and frequent travel.</p>

<p>Lately, however, I&#8217;ve been reconsidering. My office is about 30 minutes from my house, but I end up not going in more and more these days. The 1 hour roundtrip is simply wasted time, and the traditional 9-5 is an artificial constraint on both work and non-work activities.</p>

<p>The turning point, not surprisingly, was technology driven - earlier this year I was working on a shared presentation and document with 2 colleagues. We met in person twice, and the third time we used Google Wave (rip) for shared document editing and iChat for voice and video communication.</p>

<p>I was shocked at how much more efficient the third session was. I despise video calls, but in this case it was background, mainly to see who was paying attention and who was tuned out. The shared document with real-time edits worked fabulously well - one could write stream of consciousness thoughts, and before finishing the paragraph have his work edited and polished by the other two.</p>

<p>These days I find my most efficient working relationships require little in-person interaction. What they do require is a host of enabling technologies we take for granted.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m still a huge believer in the value of in-person interactions - the best ideas generally pop up over lunch or other informal settings. But in-person interaction doesn&#8217;t require the traditional office setting and trappings.</p>

<p>The work style adopted by startups today will make its way to large business, and the services that are the lifeline of that style will become the dial-tone of business. As Paul points out this will drive the creation of a number of significant companies to provide those dial-tones. And with any luck I&#8217;ll have an opportunity to invest if a few of them <img src='/web/20101213011206im_/http://parand.com/say/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' /></p>
