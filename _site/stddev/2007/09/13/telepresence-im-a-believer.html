<p>We&#8217;ve been using Cisco Telepresence systems for a month or two at work. I have to say, I&#8217;m a believer.</p>

<p>My previous experience with video conferencing had left me unimpressed at best. Choppy video in a small screen, not worth the time nor effort.</p>

<p>The cisco system consists of half a room with a roundish table and 8-10 chairs. The other half of the room is displayed on three large screens. People appearing on screen are life-sized and look approximately as though they&#8217;re sitting across the table from you. The video is extremely clear and sound is directional - the voice comes from the person speaking.</p>

<p>The important part is that after about 10 minutes you forget the other people are on a teleconference. The body language is there - the eye movements, the subtle noises, everything it takes to make it work.</p>

<p>These things are very costly - something like $300k upfront and several tens of thousands per month to operate. But the absolutely do work. I could see this cutting travel down by a very significant percentage in many situations.</p>

<p>As with all things tech I&#8217;m sure the prices will drop as the devices become more common place. I can&#8217;t wait till I have one at the house. For now the price tag severely restricts their deployments. Someone should setup it up as a per-use service with locations in all major cities.</p>

<p>If you get a chance you really should give it a try. It&#8217;s one of those things you have to experience to get a true sense of. In a few years we&#8217;ll all have these and world distances will once again be warped by technology.</p>
