<p>My laptop broke, leading to a visit to fatwallet, leading to the same old frustration with the lack of a notifier for specific new deals. I decided to finally put together a deal watcher.</p>

<p>I started with the python Universal Feed Reader, which makes it amazingly simple to deal with the fatwallet feed. Part way through I wondered if <a href='/web/20101222044518/http://pipes.yahoo.com/'>Pipes</a> would make my life even easier.</p>

<p>Turns out it does. It&#8217;s really very easy to put together something as simple as this. All I had to do was fetch the feed and filter it based on my keywords. Two components, 3 minutes, and I&#8217;m done. The result is <a href='/web/20101222044518/http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/ECUqPtTJ2xGqmOHarscPhQ'>here</a>.</p>

<p>It is pretty lame - it doesn&#8217;t take user input (I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to split the user input into multiple words and didn&#8217;t want to have multiple input fields). It doesn&#8217;t have any sort of storage to keep track of what you have and haven&#8217;t seen. It doesn&#8217;t actually notify you. It doesn&#8217;t parse the items to see what the rating is or to filter on it.</p>

<p>However, it is done, and it&#8217;s now one of my feeds in Google Reader. It&#8217;ll be interesting to see if it actually meets my needs. Sometimes pretty lame is good enough.</p>
