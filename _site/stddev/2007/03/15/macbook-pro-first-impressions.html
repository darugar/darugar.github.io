<p>My impressions of the MacBook Pro after 24 hours. This is my first Mac and I have virtually no previous experience with Mac or OS X.</p>

<p>The laptop itself: solid. Almost attractive; certainly nicer than the run-of-the-mill black plastic PCs.</p>

<p>Heavy. Much heavier than I had expected.</p>

<p>Hot! This thing gets quite hot. That&#8217;s not good at all.</p>

<p>No standard PCMCIA slot! This is almost a deal-killer; I use the verizon wireless card for nationwide internet access, so I need a PCMCIA slot. Need to look for a solution.</p>

<p>Slow! One of the reasons I got this was to enjoy the speed of the dual cores. I&#8217;m very surprised to see it so sluggish. Far too often it actually lags behind the key strokes. What&#8217;s going on here? There should be processor speed to spare. I haven&#8217;t seen windows do this in years.</p>

<p>Two fingers on the touchpad and the button to simulate right click? Are you kidding me? When are they going to drop the pretense and add a second button?</p>

<p>Camino? Camino?!? Why not firefox? Again seems a bit silly to me.</p>

<p>Lack of outlook calendar integration is a pain, but I can&#8217;t fault the Mac for that.</p>

<p>The screen is nice. The keyboard is nice.</p>

<p>Instant-on after suspend: very nice.</p>

<p>Getting used to OS X has been less painful than I had expected, although I still do lose my way here and there.</p>

<p>I guess I had already installed a lot of the nice features on windows (launcher, finder, etc), so I&#8217;m not seeing a lot of improvement.</p>

<p>Overall: Underwhelmed so far. Everybody tells me soon I&#8217;ll be in love and will never be able to go back. I await true love with baited breath.</p>

<p>I also have a brand new Vista laptop with similar specs here, so I&#8217;ll be able to do a compare and contrast soon.</p>
