<p>As the &#8220;computer guy&#8221; for my wife, various friends, and my own activities, I often see a need for a very simple &#8220;CRM&#8221; system. But it&#8217;s not really CRM; it&#8217;s more of a contact management system together with a way to send emails to various groups of friends / customers, a way to catalog past exchanges, and perhaps a simple to-do system.</p>

<p>Periodically I look at the various available options (there are many), give one or more of them a try, and give up, generally because they&#8217;re too complex and too capable.</p>

<p>The most promising is <a href='/web/20101222041117/http://www.highrisehq.com/'>High Rise</a>, but I don&#8217;t think it provides a way to send emails, so it doesn&#8217;t qualify.</p>

<p>Here are my requirements for my imaginary Pony CRM:</p>

<p>* <strong>Simple</strong>. Must be simple enough that my wife will actually use it. * <strong>Integration with Yahoo Mail / GMail</strong>. This should be generalized to POP/IMAP integration, but I find almost everyone uses one of the large providers, either Yahoo or Gmail. * <strong>Automatic synchronization with Yahoo/Gmail</strong>. There shouldn&#8217;t be an &#8220;import&#8221; option - it should always be sync&#8217;d automatically. A contact in Gmail should be immediately available in Pony CRM, and vice versa. * <strong>Easy cataloging / collection of emails</strong>. It&#8217;d be good to be able to catalog and tag email exchanges. * <strong>Easy mass email</strong>. This is the most important feature - without exception, the most common use case is: I want to email a subset of contacts and I want to track who replied, looked at what I sent, etc. For example, all of your clients that have certain investments, or all customers who&#8217;ve requested feature X, all customers who signed up before date X, and so forth, should receive a nice email. * <strong>Easy graphical email composition</strong>. Everyone wants to send a nicely formated email with graphics that&#8217;s readable in the majority of email readers, but no one can figure out how. This should be built in to the CRM tool in some way. There should be a way to store the email templates for future use. * <strong>History and Audit Trails</strong>. You should be able to figure out who you sent what to, when. * <strong>Extensibility</strong>. APIs for access to the CRM system as well as a way to integrate external feeds/ APIs/ widgets into the CRM system. * <strong>Free/Cheap Hosting with Simple Full Export</strong>. If it&#8217;s cheap enough, I can push everyone to pay the monthly fee and get the support issue off of my back. However, there must be a simple full-export option as well as an alternative means of using the exported data - eg. an open source version that could be deployed should the hosted version go out of business. Can&#8217;t have lock-in if your business depends on the data.</p>

<p>I think this covers just about everything needed. Someone please either build or point me to Pony CRM so I can be happy.</p>
