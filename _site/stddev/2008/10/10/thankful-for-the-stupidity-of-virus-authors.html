<p>For about a week now the network at home has been slow. Just as I&#8217;d get frustrated enough to do something about it it&#8217;d get fast again, so I procrastinated.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was cursing Time Warner, Linksys, Apple, and just about everybody else whose hardware I own. The Linksys wireless router is 5 years old, but come on, it should still work!</p>

<p>This morning my wife complained of web access on the desktop being slow, so I sat down to take a look. Sure enough, very slow. It was odd that the computer itself wasn&#8217;t as responsive as it used to be, but then it is a windows box, so curse Microsoft.</p>

<p>As I was dialing Time Warner to schedule someone to come out and take a look I started to look for a bandwidth tester so I could prove how crappy their service was. Oddly the search results didn&#8217;t actually go to a bandwidth meter, but rather to an intermediary page with lots of links to bandwidth meters.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s when I realized: I gots me a virus. Fantastic. It&#8217;s sitting there eating my bandwidth, probably spamming the world.</p>

<p>Point is, I was ready to blame everyone in the world instead of thinking it&#8217;s a virus. If the virus authors hadn&#8217;t put in the search redirection they could&#8217;ve probably lived on for another month sending their merry spam.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m certain a clever virus could infect a very large percentage of the world&#8217;s computers without anyone noticing. Probably already has.</p>
