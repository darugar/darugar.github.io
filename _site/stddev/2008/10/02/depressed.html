<p>Watching the Palin/Biden debate and the subsequent babbling by the TV talking heads has me depressed. Nothing of substance was said during the entire debate. What we witnessed was an audition for a supporting role in a B movie, not a debate between potential 2nd in commands of the most powerful country in the world.</p>

<p>Apparently these folks haven&#8217;t noticed, but we&#8217;re in the midst of the most serious economic downturn since the great depression. We&#8217;re neck deep in two active wars. There are serious problems to solve. Are sound bites, repeated claims of &#8220;maverick&#8221;, and milf references really the best we have to offer?</p>

<p>What is depressing is not that these folks talk in pre-cooked, substance-free parrotings, but that we really and truly are stupid enough to not only tolerate, but to encourage this.</p>

<p>Please, give me something to vote on beyond how folksy, how old, how female, how dark, and how maverick these people are. I&#8217;m not trying to pick the person who looks the most like the president, but the one who will act the most president.</p>

<p>Bah. Humbug.</p>
