<p>All the cool kids are into Git these days and I&#8217;ve been reading plenty of articles about how good it is and how to use it. The problem is, I don&#8217;t really have a problem with Subversion. I know I should, because all the cool kids do, but I just don&#8217;t run into a lot of issues with it. In the absence of a problem to solve it would simply be peer-pressure to give Git a shot.</p>

<p>So in an attempt to remain <a href='/web/20101222051957/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qANMjwLmo6Y'>ever-so-independent</a> I&#8217;m going to try a distributed system, but not Git. I&#8217;m going with <a href='/web/20101222051957/http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/'>Mercurial</a>.</p>

<p>Actually mainly it&#8217;s because Mercurial seems significantly simpler, and I&#8217;m a simple guy. It&#8217;s also written in Python, which gives me a warm and fuzzy. And I&#8217;m finally motivated to try it because I&#8217;m going to try a code path which may not work out, and I understand these distributed systems deal with that well.</p>

<p>Hmm. The main thing I&#8217;d want from a source code control system would be a bit of packaging and deployment intelligence built in. Maybe something to minify and join my javascript files and mend the files that reference them. I&#8217;m extremely pleased not to have a &#8220;make&#8221; step anywhere in my process, but I do miss some of the capabilities.</p>

<p>If I&#8217;m making a mistake and I should go with Git, or perhaps CVS, do let me know.</p>
