<p>What I know about the innards automobiles I learned from a book on <a href='/web/20101222052154/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wankel_engine'>Wankel engines</a> when I was 8. So when my &#8220;check engine&#8221; light turned on I knew I&#8217;d be in for a severe siphoning of money out of my pocket.</p>

<p>Buoyed by my strong sense of miserliness, however, I decided to take a stand and brave the world mechanical. And I&#8217;m proud to say I managed to change a broken O2 sensor on my Honda Accord without having to visit a mechanic (or, to be more accurate, watched as my dad changed it, but hey, I was there).</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s the key trick: all cars built since 1996 have a standard system called OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics) that monitors much of your car and its health and reports standard codes for any mis-behaving components. There are code readers available from your favorite retailer (here&#8217;s <a href='/web/20101222052154/http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&amp;location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FActron-CP9125-PocketScan-Diagnostic-Post-1996%2Fdp%2FB0007LEG2K%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dautomotive%26qid%3D1219868907%26sr%3D1-2&amp;tag=parandcom-20&amp;linkCode=ur2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325'>one from Amazon for $62</a><img src='/web/20101222052154im_/http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=parandcom-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1' alt='' />) or to borrow from certain auto repair shops.</p>

<p>Connecting the reader to car is generally easy (it was simply a matter of attaching it to the connector under the steering wheel in the Honda) and you can find explanations for the codes online.</p>

<p>Armed with information about what exactly is wrong with your car you can have a much more â€¦ productive conversation with your mechanic.</p>

<p>Or, you can fix it yourself, as we did. Changing the O2 sensor turned out to be surprisingly simple, and not only did I save myself about $300, I also feel extremely proud of myself. I think this is my crowning achievement of 2008. Handy, I am.</p>
