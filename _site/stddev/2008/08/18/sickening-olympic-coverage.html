<p>Watching the women&#8217;s uneven bars. The announcers have spent the vast majority of the time whining and moaning Nastia&#8217;s the 2nd place finish.</p>

<p>Now I recall earlier gymnastics events where these same announcers said starting first is a huge disadvantage and effectively penalizes the American competitor (pretty sure it was Shawn Johnson&#8217;s event). Hmm. The Chinese winner of this event went first. I didn&#8217;t hear any whining about how she was at a disadvantage.</p>

<p>We&#8217;re also hearing about the incompetency of the judges. Apparently the Australian judge favors the Chinese. Makes sense that Australia would pick China over US. Eh. I&#8217;m sure it does somehow. Nevermind that his score was actually thrown out (top and bottom scores are thrown out).</p>

<p>The tie-break procedure is also apparently anti-U.S. I&#8217;ve heard Al-Qaeda was behind instituting it.</p>

<p>Watching the track events earlier I was shocked to see there were 8 athletes running in each heat. The announcers announced 2, and the camera was very clear that there were only 2 athletes running. Turns out there are other countries competing besides America. Which really pisses me off - don&#8217;t they know it&#8217;s ALL ABOUT AMERICA?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sick of NBC. These guys are making America look like a bunch whining, sore losers, which is anything but the truth. The athletes are doing a fantastic job and the venue is beautiful. If only these NBC idiots would embrace the spirit of the Olympics and realize it&#8217;s not all America versus the rest of the world. It&#8217;s a celebration of the athletic spirit of the world.</p>

<p>There we go. And they finish with how America&#8217;s dominance of baseball and softball is so complete the Olympic committee had to drop them from the Olympics.</p>

<p>Think back to high school, to the rich kid who was a good athlete and had everything else going for him, but was still an asshole? There you go. Apparently that&#8217;s who we are. Despite everything we have we still can&#8217;t find it in ourselves to be gracious.</p>

<p>Damned Australia.</p>
