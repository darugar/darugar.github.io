<p>I caught Peter Semmelhack&#8217;s talk at ETech and also had a chance to chat with him and <a href='/web/20101222033653/http://www.buglabs.net/users/mehrshad'>Mershad</a> over lunch. <a href='/web/20101222033653/http://www.buglabs.net/'>Bug Labs</a> sounded interesting - an open hardware platform where functionality can be added as modules, almost like connecting legos together. But it turns out there&#8217;s more to it than that.</p>

<p>Bug labs also deals with the programming interface for the devices and sensors, abstracting the functionality as web services. The device runs its own on-board web server, so getting an image from the camera is as easy as going to the url for the for the camera on the device - something like http://deviceaddress/service/camera . Apparently it implements OSGI, which would allow automated discovery and such (I&#8217;m a bit surprised they used OSGI in this context actually, but it does make sense).</p>

<p>I think the form factor is going to be very important - a physical device has to be physically appealing. The bug is not unattractive, but it&#8217;s not going to be as small or convenient as a purpose-built device. On the other hand, as Peter mentioned, there are lots of niches for devices that aren&#8217;t mass market (eg. devices for the blind) that the Bug could address.</p>

<p>I initially thought the main appeal was the modularity and ability to add sensors, but I think the open programming interface might be a bigger deal. Imagine a cell phone (or GPS device) that you had full programmable access to. Looks like this would be a fun thing to play with.</p>
