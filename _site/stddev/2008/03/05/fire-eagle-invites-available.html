<p>Saw <a href='/web/20101222033442/http://www.plasticbag.org/'>Tom Coates</a>&#8217; talk on <a href='/web/20101222033442/http://fireeagle.com/'>Fire Eagle</a> at ETech today. Actually quite different from what I had expected. It&#8217;s basically a service into which devices and apps can feed location information, users can control access rights to that information, and devices and apps can consume a normalized and standardized view of that information. It&#8217;s interesting that it&#8217;s not just a set of APIs, but also a service that implements those APIs.</p>

<p>This has a lot of potential. Anyone can create a location provider, and anyone can build apps using those locations. Users have a unified place to deal with permissions. For example I could have my GPS from my blackberry be a location provider, or I could create a FireFox plug-in that tires to determine my location based on my IP address, or any number of other things. I could also write an app that doesn&#8217;t care what device is providing the location or in what format and deals only with the FireEagle service.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m hoping to write a FireFox plug-in location provider, but likely it&#8217;ll join my list of projects I&#8217;ll never get around to. <a href='/web/20101222033442/http://www.hostip.info/'>hostip.info</a> already has most of what&#8217;s needed.</p>

<p>I have two invites, let me know if you want one.</p>
