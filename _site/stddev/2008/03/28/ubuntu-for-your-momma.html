<p>I spent 5 hours last weekend trying to get rid of the multitude of the viruses and bugs that had taken over my parent&#8217;s laptop. Apparently they literally had little bugs and critters running around their screen singing and playing music.</p>

<p>I tried two antivirus programs but neither could clean out everything. I finally gave up and asked them about their usage patterns. Turns out they use the laptop fairly exclusively for the web - banking, booking flights, etc. I suggested installing linux and surprisingly they were up for it.</p>

<p>So here I am trying the Hardy Heron beta install on their laptop. First impressions: nice installer! It detects the screen dimensions correctly (and it&#8217;s not a standard size display). An attractive background pops up and you&#8217;re in a nice windowed mouse based installer.</p>

<p>The <em>Prepare disk space</em> step is taking a very long time - I wonder if it&#8217;s still alive?</p>

<p>It comes back with an error - <em>there was an error in resizing</em> - but when I hit back and try again it seems to work.</p>

<p>Too many blank or non-responsive screens - is it still alive or dead?</p>

<p>Dead I guess, it seemed to not be doing anything.</p>

<p>After a reboot the install seems to be going well. I&#8217;m impressed that it&#8217;s only a few questions and clicks before it starts the actual install - that&#8217;s very good.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s done. Overall, quite nice. It&#8217;s automatically picked out the correct screen size, wireless and sound are working, suspend works - looks like it&#8217;s all set.</p>

<p>The fonts are not looking so great<del>, let me see I can do something about that</del>. Followed the instructions from the <a href='/web/20101222032427/http://ubuntu.wordpress.com/2005/09/09/installing-microsoft-fonts/'>Ubuntu Blog</a> and installed windows fonts, also enabled anti-aliasing, looking decent now.</p>

<p>The interesting part will be how my parents fare in using it. I&#8217;ll post updates.</p>
