<p>Continuing the <a href='/web/20101222033429/http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/03/13/the-2-myths-that-gets-students-into-heavy-league-schools/'>conversation with Daniel</a>,</p>

<p>» Lectures are not where you learn, I agree. I missed as many lectures as I attended as an undergrad. Grad school is a different story as lectures tend to be more conversational and informative and the material more challenging.</p>

<p>» A lot of the smartest professors are terrible lecturers. Another little story: one of my grad school professor&#8217;s lecture consisted of standing in silence, staring at the class in misery, writing an equation on the board, staring at it, turning back and staring at the class, and saying &#8220;there&#8221;. This was the normal session.</p>

<p>» The best pre-recorded lecturers are likely better than your average live lecture. But most learning takes place outside the lecture.</p>

<p>» <strong>Being there physically is still very important</strong>. A study at Google found <a href='/web/20101222033429/http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/03/etech-google-pr.html'>physical proximity is the single highest determinant of people voting the same way</a>, which is interpreted as a good measure of information flow. I&#8217;m a big <a href='/web/20101222033429/http://parand.com/say/index.php/2007/09/13/telepresence-im-a-believer/'>believer in telepresence</a>, but there is no way telepresence is a substitute for physically attending the same university as someone else. At one point in undergrad my friend and I spent 3 days physically locked up in a lab creating a visual perception system, on a whim. No way that would&#8217;ve happened over telepresence. Eating tacos at 3am with your cohorts is an integral part of the experience. This is why Paul Graham (since we&#8217;re quoting Paul <img src='/web/20101222033429im_/http://parand.com/say/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';-)' /> ) forces the startups he funds to move to where he is.</p>

<p>» Chance interactions with people due to physical proximity carry as much or more information as pre-scheduled meetings. The same professor who would stare at the board in his lectures was incredibly insightful and helpful when I asked for his help as I ran into him in the hallway of the CS department. So were any number of my classmates that co-habitated that dungeon of a building.</p>

<p>» Good universities are filters for smarts and achievement. The level of drive and ability you&#8217;ll find at Berkeley is certainly different than what you&#8217;ll find at your local community college. The average level of drive and ability falls off from the top schools to the lesser schools. Would you want to spend 4+ years with the smartest, most driven people you could find, or with less smart, less driven people?</p>

<p>» Smart people don&#8217;t want to talk to you unless you pass the filters. Daniel mentions: &#8220;… you could just go on the Web and interact with super-smart people from all over the world without having to pay Harvard-level tuitions&#8221; and that bandwidth and latency are the primary barriers. They&#8217;re not. Part of what you pay for when you pay Harvard tuition is the privilege of talking to very smart people. Those same smart people wouldn&#8217;t talk to you if you were some random person who hadn&#8217;t passed a smarts filter because you&#8217;d likely be a waste of their time. Daniel is a professor at a well known school and as such can call on smart people as he likes; try doing the same as an undergrad in a community college.</p>

<p>» Expectations are important. What&#8217;s expected of the average student at a name school is quite different than what&#8217;s expected of a student at a community college. Again it&#8217;s a gradient. I firmly believe what you expect to achieve is a key indicator of what you will achieve.</p>

<p>For all these reasons I think you should go the &#8220;best&#8221; school you can get into, physically be there, and live in the dorms (I commuted). This doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t achieve everything you want going to a &#8220;lesser&#8221; school, but you&#8217;ll have to work harder at it.</p>
