<p>I&#8217;m watching a Yahoo Research talk by <a href='/web/20101222033529/http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~christos/'>Christos Papadimitriou</a>. Reminds me of a grad school storyâ€¦</p>

<p>I was hanging around the grad student lounge, chatting with a friend about the computational theory class and our difficulty in grasping all the concepts. Christos was a professor at UCSD at the time and had literally written the book on the subject.</p>

<p>In the middle of our chat Christos himself walked into the lounge to get a snack. We worked up the courage to admit our lack of understanding and asked him to enlighten us on the whole topic.</p>

<p>We sat around the table, soon to be joined by 3 more grad students, and Christos started talking.</p>

<p>I learned more in the next 45 minutes than I had in 6 months. The hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. For the next three days I felt I understood everything. Not just computational theory mind you, <strong>everything</strong>.</p>

<p>Within a week I was back to my clueless self, but those few days of clarity were amazing.</p>

<p>This is why I think <a href='/web/20101222033529/http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/02/27/online-teaching-is-the-future/'>physical presence in universities</a> still matters, and <a href='/web/20101222033529/http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2007/09/05/it-may-not-matter-all-that-much-where-you-go-to-college/'>where you go to school also matters</a>. <a href='/web/20101222033529/http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/03/07/who-needs-your-lectures-anymore/'>Lectures may be delivered as effectively online</a>, but there&#8217;s much more to university than lectures.</p>
