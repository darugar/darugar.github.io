<p>Most of my contacts are in LinkedIn, but you can&#8217;t store phones numbers, IM addresses, etc, there. The vast majority of my phone contacts are in my cell phone, but those die every time I kill a phone, which is about every 3-6 months these days. I used to use Yahoo Mail contacts, but since I couldn&#8217;t get that contact list to sync with my phone it stopped being useful. GMail contacts are generally fairly useless as well.</p>

<p>So here we go again. New phone, new contact I need to store, where do I put it? Plaxo seems like a reasonable solution, but I remember bad creepy stuff from them a few years ago so I&#8217;m hesitant to jump back in with that.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m thinking a system where you can express relationships, ala LinkedIn or FaceBook, and contact details are published and maintained by the person you know (as opposed to you) is a good thing. Combine this with the FriendFeed / Venturehacks Recommended model where you can create entries for people that are not on the network yet, and allow syncing with phone or otherwise make it always-available, and you got something good. Also will need the ability to identify contacts as personal, business, etc.</p>

<p>What do you use, and do you like it?</p>
