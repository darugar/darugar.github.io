<p>With Javascript, particularly when used correctly, which for me means in the Way Of JQuery, the thought process is more like &#8220;When some event happens, this guy will wake up and he&#8217;ll know what to do. He&#8217;ll remember his name, what he was supposed to work on, and he&#8217;ll be carrying his own tools. He might get blocked at some point, but then he&#8217;ll just wait around and when he&#8217;s ready to go he&#8217;ll remember who he is, what he was doing, and how far along doing it he was. And when he&#8217;s done he&#8217;ll go away and along with him will go his tools and any other mess he made&#8221;.</p>

<p>Javascript is a lot more &#8220;guy with the thing&#8221; thinking instead of &#8220;what&#8217;s on this shelf here?&#8221; thinking. I guess that&#8217;s called closures, or something like that. Anyway, I&#8217;m liking it.</p>
