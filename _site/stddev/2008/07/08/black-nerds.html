<p>Interesting essay from David Adewumi on <a href='/web/20110106035601/http://davidadewumi.com/2008/07/06/why-are-black-nerds-so-unpopular/'>Why Black Nerds Are Unpopular</a>. My observation on nerdism and popularity, based on going to school in three different continents, is that &#8220;nerds&#8221; are an American invention. Popularity, or lack thereof, is of course universal, but being a social outcast due to intelligence is mostly American.</p>

<p>In Iran, for example, I&#8217;d say it was much closer to &#8220;winners&#8221; and &#8220;losers&#8221;. The smartest kids were often also the popular kids, and they also often participated in sports. My main arch-nemesis in school (later my best friend) was not only one of the top students, but also our best athlete. Being smart was not a detriment to popularity.</p>

<p>In England I remember learning the concept of &#8220;nerd&#8221; from America sitcoms, and being mostly puzzled. I only went to school for three years there and even that in a private school, so I can&#8217;t vouch for general public schools, but I don&#8217;t think the concept of nerd is very strong there either. Being popular or unpopular certainly exists, but intelligence doesn&#8217;t carry the kind of stigma it does in the US.</p>
