<p>Watching the Euro 2008 games. Yes, many days late.</p>

<p>The Germany-Turkey game was an interesting one. The entire time watching I was reminded of our European trip, oh, about 10 years ago.</p>

<p>We spent a lot of time sharing trains with lots of people from lots of countries. Twice with Germans.</p>

<p>The first was with 2 excellent, lovely guys who were traveling the world riding roller coasters. They were very excited when they found out we were from California, apparently home to some of the world&#8217;s best. They really turned out to be nice guys and we spent a long time chatting.</p>

<p>They made a point of talking about the changes in Germany; the fall of the wall, the changes in attitudes, and the new-found tolerance. It seemed the shadow of the Nazi legacy weighed on their minds and it was important for them to erase it.</p>

<p>Fair enough. I know a number of people living in Germany, both natives and foreigners, and they all seem to like it. A good friend of mine, of Iranian descent, found his soul in Heidelberg. Anyway, I had no trouble believing what they had to say.</p>

<p>Then, some time later, the discussion turned to the Turks.</p>

<p>It turned out the Turks were the cause of all evils in Germany, usurping German jobs, dealing drugs, stealing, and generally not being very neighbourly.</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t think much of it; every country has a group they blame for everything.</p>

<p>And then they said something like &#8220;… and we have to round them all up and burn them&#8221;.</p>

<p>Huh.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>The second German we spent time with was a female DJ touring Europe, apparently a well known one. The pattern of conversation was similar - the tolerance and changes, followed by a clear, although much less harsh condemnation of the Turks.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>A few weeks ago I met a young man from Germany. I asked him where he was from, and he told me he was Turkish. I asked where he was born, and he said Germany. &#8220;Then you&#8217;re German&#8221;, I said. &#8220;No&#8221;, was his simple reply, and his expression told the whole story.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Obviously a sample size of two doesn&#8217;t mean anything, but it&#8217;s come to flavor my impression of Germany. I hope to increase my sample size and dispel this impression.</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Anyway, I was rooting for Turkey.</p>
