<p>My brother-in-law bought Arabian Nights (aka 1001 nights) to read to his 2 year old daughter, thinking they&#8217;d be nice, quaint stories. He thought better of it and gave it to me, so I gave it a quick read.</p>

<p>You probably know the general story: there&#8217;s a cruel king that marries a woman each day and kills her the next, until one special girl enchants him with 1001 stories so intriguing that he can&#8217;t bear to kill her.</p>

<p>Well, here&#8217;s the start of the whole story, explaining why the king is so cruel:</p>

<p>Two brothers rule two kingdoms. One invites the other to come over for a visit. Shortly after the visiting brother leaves his palace, he misses his wife so much he decides to go back and give her a final kiss. On returning he finds his wife and her court having far too good a time with their male slaves.</p>

<p>Devastated, he kills the wife and leaves to visit his brother.</p>

<p>He&#8217;s happy to see the brother, but is so distraught over his wife he&#8217;s not much of a sport. He decides to skip the hunting party and stay at the palace.</p>

<p>The brother&#8217;s wife, thinking the men are away, throws a party of her own, and proceeds to similarly get down with the slaves. The visiting brother accidentally witnesses this and eventually tells his brother, who promptly strangles the wife.</p>

<p>The two brothers are so distraught they decide to leave their kingdoms and not return until they find someone more miserable than themselves.</p>

<p>As they&#8217;re about to make camp in the wilderness they see a giant genie (a nasty, gnarly one, not a cute one like the movies) emerge out of the lake. They quickly hide in a tree.</p>

<p>The genie comes over to the tree, produces a locked chest out of which he brings out a woman, and decides to take a nap while resting his head in her lap.</p>

<p>As the genie sleeps, the woman spies the men in the tree and orders them down. At first they refuse, but she threatens to wake the genie, so down they head.</p>

<p>She produces a string with 98 rings attached, and explains there&#8217;s a ring for each man she&#8217;s had a chance to party with since the genie has held her captive, and that she wants to make it an even 100.</p>

<p>The brothers, convinced that the genie is indeed more miserable than them, return to their kingdoms, and one of them takes up the lovely habit of marrying a virgin each day and killing her the next, since, clearly, womens can&#8217;t be trusted.</p>

<p>Now with a start like that, how can you not read the rest? Enchanting stories indeed.</p>
