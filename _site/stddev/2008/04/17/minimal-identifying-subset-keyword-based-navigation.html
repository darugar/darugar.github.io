<p>Operating systems and applications need to support a mode wherein typing the smallest identifying subset of keys will cause the appropriate file/function to be opened. Firefox 3 does this for history urls - start typing and you&#8217;ll see URLs that contain that set of keystrokes anywhere in them. iPhone&#8217;s safari also does a decent job. Adium does a basic version: you can hit apple-N to get a New Message window and type the start of the person&#8217;s name. I think Quicksilver also does this although I&#8217;ve never been able to make heads or tails of it.</p>

<p>Every application should do it. Eg. Eclipse - it&#8217;s silly for me to go hunting for the file I&#8217;m looking for in the tab + drop-down list of files I&#8217;m editing. I should be able to hit Ctrl-Something and start typing some piece of the name of the file and it should show up.</p>

<p>On the command line - it&#8217;s silly to type in the full path to get at the directory I want when it has a set of uniquely identifying (or at least narrowing down) set of keywords.</p>

<p>In adium, instead of showing only the contacts that start with what I&#8217;m typing, show contacts that have those characters anywhere in their name. How am I supposed to know Max&#8217;s id is crazymax2007 ? I just want to type max.</p>

<p>In short, I should be able to hit some hot-key combination, type a few letters, and get access to the most common functions and files that are identified by that set of letters, from every application.</p>
