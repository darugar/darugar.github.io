            <p>I'm noticing how much the practice of finding a candidate and interviewing them has changed over the years.</p>
<p>First step is to look up the person on the web. Since I'm looking for a technical person I'm expecting a blog, contributions to open source projects, a twitter presence, etc. If I don't find them, the candidate becomes less attractive.</p>
<p>If I do find a blog or twitter feed, I take some time to read them. You can tell a lot about a person with just a short overview - for example, even a delicious feed can give you a very good feel for how good someone is technically.</p>
<p>Hopefully the person has an open source project or two they've contributed. If so you can dive right into the code and get a good sense of their skills at work. I love this - you can see great coders almost immediately. And of course bad ones.</p>
<p>If the person is still looking good it's time for a review of the resume and their linkedin profile.</p>
<p>By the time I followup with the person I have a very good sense of who this person is, what they've done in the past, and what their real-world coding looks like. The people who make it to the interview are so well filtered you almost can't go wrong.</p>
<p>It's very time consuming, but if you're as fanatical about hiring good people as I am it's worth it.</p>
<p>Contrast this with the old pile-o-resumes approach, or the recruiter-filter-by-keyword approach, and I think we're in a much better place.</p>
<p>Now if I could only find a recruiter I could trust to do the technical deep dive I've described here and be ingenious enough to find diamonds in the rough I'd be a very happy man.</p>
