[Disco](/web/20101222052832/http://discoproject.org/) is a map-reduce framework written in Erlang and Python. Seems reasonable - I definitely prefer Python to Java for writing maps and reduces, and Erlang is rumored to be good at parallel stuff.

Interestingly no mention of an underlying distributed file system.
