I went to a school that required uniforms \(private school in England\). We were forced to be uniform.

This afternoon driving by the high school near my house I was amused to see uniforms everywhere - here a patch of girls all wearing the same types of shorts, with hair pulled back, there a group of emo kids all wearing shades of near identical clothes.

It's lovely. We all need to be different in our uniform ways.
