> The Rev. Ted Haggard admitted Friday he bought methamphetamine from a male prostitute but maintained he never had sex with the man and never used the drug.

> I bought it for myself but never used it. I was tempted but I never used it," he said, smiling constantly from the driver's seat of his pickup truck as he answered questions from reporters outside his home.
> 
> Jones \[the male prostitute\] said his acquaintance with Haggard - whom he knew as "Art" - lasted about three years, with Haggard calling him every month or so and paying him for sex. Haggard's middle name is Arthur.
> 
> Jones said he learned Haggard's real name about six months ago while watching a History Channel program on which Haggard was interviewed. Jones began researching Haggard and discovered his church's positions on same-sex marriage.
> 
> "I got to tell you, I started getting pissed," he said.
