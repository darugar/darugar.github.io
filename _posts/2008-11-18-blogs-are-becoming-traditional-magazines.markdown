Have you noticed how more and more the headlines of the top blogs are all the same announcement at the same time? Unfortunately we're going back to the PR-firm driven news reporting that was prevalent in the era of magazines, instead of that brief but wonderful time when bloggers actually thought for themselves and found stories of their own liking. At least magazines had standards related to grammar and some base level of fact checking, but oh well.

On the bright side the blog world is wide and deep enough to provide lots of interesting news sources, even if they turn out not to be the top blogs.
