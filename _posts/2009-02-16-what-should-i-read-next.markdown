I was thinking about what book to read next and it occurred to me to ask you nice people. I'm in the mood for something factual but interesting - something like [The Prize](http://www.amazon.com/Prize-Epic-Quest-Money-Power/dp/0671799320/), if you're familiar with that. I was intrigued by [Fiasco](http://www.amazon.com/Fiasco-American-Military-Adventure-Iraq/dp/0143038915/) but I haven't looked into it.

So what do you say, what should I read next?
