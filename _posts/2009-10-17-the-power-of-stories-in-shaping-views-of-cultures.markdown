Impressive Ted Talk by Chimamanda Adichie on how stories, and in particular "single stories", shape our views of cultures. Many parallels with how people typically see Iran. 

A great quote from the talk: "_The problem with stereotypes is not that they are untrue - it is that they are incomplete_".
