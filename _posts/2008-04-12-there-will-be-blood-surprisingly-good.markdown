I had watched about half of [There Will Be Blood](/web/20081227235805/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/), enjoyed it, but was surprisingly un-motivated to watch the rest. Tonight I finally watched the second half.

The first half of the movie is quite good, and Daniel Day-Lewis is fantastic. But the second half takes an unexpected turn and suddenly you're face to face with a beautiful character study.

I don't recall a movie diving into hatred as well this one has in a long time. Little by little it turns and material success unleashes the deep misery of the main character. "I have a competition in me" he says, and we see the results of that competition.

Nicely done, well worth watching.
