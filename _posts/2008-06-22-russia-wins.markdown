Just finished watching Russia vs. Netherlands. Most of it anyway - I'd only DVR'd the main match, missed most of the extra time.

What a fantastic game. Arshavin is the real deal, looking forward to seeing more of him. Sorry to all my Dutch buddies, but Russia really looked like they wanted it. I'm always impressed when the underdog comes out to win instead of play to tie.

We don't get nearly enough football in the US, I'm really enjoying Euro2008 in HD.
