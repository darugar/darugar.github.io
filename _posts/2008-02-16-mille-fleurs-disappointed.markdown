[Mille Fleurs](/web/20101222053829/http://www.millefleurs.com/) is one of San Diego's better known high end restaurants. We ate there with some friends last night and once again I was disappointed. The lobster bisque was luke-warm and a tad salty. The steak was good, but only cooked on one end \(I'm not even sure how that's possible\). My friend asked for one of the dishes to be prepared without meat and ended up with an extremely bland pasta, devoid of any flavor. The lamb was ok, but my wife found the lamb we had at [Robbie and Julie's](/web/20101222053829/http://www.dining-details.com/) much better. The dessert was slightly better fare, but overall quite disappointing. My previous dining experience there was similar - underwhelmed. I think I'm done with Mille Fleurs.
