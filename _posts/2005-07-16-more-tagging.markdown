[Sound Advice](/web/20101222040042/http://members.optusnet.com.au/benjamincarlyle/benjamin/blog/2005/07/16/#file-tagging) and [Blueslugs](/web/20101222040042/http://blueslugs.com/wordpress/index.php/archives/2005/07/12/tag1-delicious-style-file-tagging/) weighing in on tagging in general and for unix file system respectively.
