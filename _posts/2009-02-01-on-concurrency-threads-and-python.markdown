Nice and detailed article from Jesse Noller on [concurrency, threads, the GIL, and Python](http://jessenoller.com/2009/02/01/python-threads-and-the-global-interpreter-lock/). Worth a read; I learned a lot from it.

For the record I'm one of the people who doesn't think threads are not the true solution to the concurrency problem.
