I find people are often curious and ignorant of the social norms in Iran. Here's a representative snippet in photos:

Unmarried couples of the opposite sex are not permitted to associate with each other in public. Women are required to cover their hair and bodies at all times when in public.

A very large portion of the Iranian population is young \(under 30\).

What does this mix result in? An [interesting cycle easily observed in parks](/web/20101222050458/http://www.payvand.com/news/06/oct/1307.html).
