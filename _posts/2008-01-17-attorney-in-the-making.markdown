I send my older son to get my middle son so they can get to bed. The conversation that ensues:

"My dad needs you upstairs"

"Why, did I do something bad?"

"No, just come upstairs"

"Why?"

"He wants you to brush your teeth"

"Did you brush your teeth?"

"No, just come upstairs"

"Are we going to bed?"

"Just come upstairs"

"I don't need to brush my teeth"

"My dad needs you upstairs"

"Why?"

â€¦
