The following worked for me for unlocking the Cingular BlackBerry Pearl I recently got:

  * Figure out your IMEI number. Press \*\#06\# to find it.
  * Go to [unlock8800](/web/20101222043153/http://www.unlock8800.com/) and pay for your unlock code. Mine arrived via email the next morning. I paid $20.
  * Use the instructions [here](/web/20101222043153/http://www.askstudent.com/hacking/how-to-unlock-the-blackberry-pearl-and-enter-blackberry-unlock-codes/) to enter the unlock code. The instructions you get from the unlock8800 guys aren't too clear; you don't need to press each key for MEPPD and MEPP2 twice; ie. to get the letter P you push the \[OP\] key just once.
  * Note that when you first go the "SIM Card" page you won't see what you type, but once you enter MEPPD correctly you'll see a menu.
