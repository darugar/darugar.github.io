Several friends have been at work on several startups and are looking for technology leaders to round out their teams. One opportunity is in the social network / eduction space and is looking for the VP Technology / CTO as well as good web/php guys. Another is more hardware related. Both are very viable early stage companies in San Diego. If you have interest or know of people who might let me know - darugar at gmail .
