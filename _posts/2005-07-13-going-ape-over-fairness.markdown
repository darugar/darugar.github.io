I love this kind of thing. From [New Scientist](http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4179):

> Knowing when you have been ripped off is not solely a human skill, biologists have discovered. Monkeys can spot a raw deal when they see one, and if they are not treated fairly they throw a tantrum.

You can gain so much insight into the behaviour of sophisticated people in complex situations by observing the behaviour of monkeys and children.
