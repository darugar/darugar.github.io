I'm watching a Yahoo Research talk by [Christos Papadimitriou](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~christos/). Reminds me of a grad school storyâ€¦

I was hanging around the grad student lounge, chatting with a friend about the computational theory class and our difficulty in grasping all the concepts. Christos was a professor at UCSD at the time and had literally written the book on the subject. 

In the middle of our chat Christos himself walked into the lounge to get a snack. We worked up the courage to admit our lack of understanding and asked him to enlighten us on the whole topic.

We sat around the table, soon to be joined by 3 more grad students, and Christos started talking. 

I learned more in the next 45 minutes than I had in 6 months. The hairs on the back of my neck were standing up. For the next three days I felt I understood everything. Not just computational theory mind you, **everything**.

Within a week I was back to my clueless self, but those few days of clarity were amazing. 

This is why I think [physical presence in universities](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/02/27/online-teaching-is-the-future/) still matters, and [where you go to school also matters](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2007/09/05/it-may-not-matter-all-that-much-where-you-go-to-college/). [Lectures may be delivered as effectively online](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/03/07/who-needs-your-lectures-anymore/), but there's much more to university than lectures.
