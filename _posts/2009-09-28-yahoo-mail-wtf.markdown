I still have a big soft spot in my heart for Yahoo, but Yahoo mail, WTF?

![Yahoo Mail WTF?](/web/20101222053252im_/http://parand.com/say/misc/yahoo-mail-wtf.png)

Of the entire screen only the area I've highlighted in orange is dedicated to the contents of the message. And this is with the app maximized to full screen.

The interface is unusable as a mail reader: I can't read the email message.

How on earth did the product people agree to this? Where's the customer advocate?
