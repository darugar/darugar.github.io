Just last week I was calling for someone to [hack up the Wiimote for PC use](/web/20080420131500/http://www.parand.com/say/index.php/2006/11/25/please-hack-the-wiimote-for-pc-use/), and lo-and-behold, it's here\!

[Hack-a-day](/web/20080420131500/http://www.hackaday.com/2006/12/02/wiimote-windows-drivers/) gives an overview, [Wii Hacks](/web/20080420131500/http://wiihacks.blogspot.com/) has lots of different hacks, and Bob Somers has even build a [Wiimote Drum Machine](/web/20080420131500/http://www.bobsomers.com/2006/12/06/wii-drum-machine/).

Apparently you grab the [GlovePIE](/web/20080420131500/http://carl.kenner.googlepages.com/glovepie) program, get yourself a bluetooth sensor, and you're off and running.

If only I had some time to play with thisâ€¦
