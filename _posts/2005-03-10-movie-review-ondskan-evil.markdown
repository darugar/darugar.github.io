I watched [Ondskan \(Evil\)](/web/20120203073636/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0338309/).

Decent movie, fairly juvenile. It pushes all the buttons to build the tension, the hatred of the mean mean bad guys. The hero is so noble, so cute, such a good boy really. It's one of those experiences where you find yourself rooting for the good guy and hating the bad guys with a visceral, childish surge. The ploy at the end is predictable and not overly satisfying.

Having said that, there are some nice aspects. It reminded me of real friendships, the kind you form when you're young and emotions are pure. I enjoyed it overall, although not on any fancy, intellectual level; this is just a fun, let's hate the bad guys kinda ride. 

I'd rate this one as Watch if it comes your way.
