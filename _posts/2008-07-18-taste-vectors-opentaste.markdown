I couple of years ago I wrote about [Taste Vectors](/web/20101222045751/http://parand.com/say/index.php/2005/03/10/taste-vectors-own-share-your-tastes-via-xml/), did a bit of hacking, and not much else.

The [Strands](/web/20101222045751/http://www.strands.com/) folks have launched a similar concept in [OpenTaste](/web/20101222045751/http://www.opentaste.net/). Worth a look, will write more if I get a chance.
