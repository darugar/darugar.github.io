[No Country For Old Men](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0477348/) is an odd film. The film ends and you're sitting there thinking: huh, that was strange…

The next day: that was a good movie, I should watch it again…

The following day: That was a great movie\!

It's the quintessential non-hollywood movie, consistently doing things that make perfect sense but surprise you. Javier Bardem is particularly good.

Go see it.
