Inaugration day, and I missed just about all the festivities. One thing did stand out for me: the text of the [Oath of the Office of the President](/web/20090201030654/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oath_of_office_of_the_President_of_the_United_States):

"I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my Ability, **preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States**."

Preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States. Those founding fathers were smart.

Here's hoping the new president takes the constitution more seriously than the last one and defends it instead of trying to diminish it.
