I'm surprised to find I use Chrome pretty regularly already. It's mostly my interface to Gmail, Google Reader, and GCal, and sits quietly in the task bar until I need to check email. Lack of firebug and various other extensions prevent me from using it for everything, but it's part of the regular line-up of apps.
