My new printer has a document feeder which makes scanning of multiple pages easy, but I didn't know how to kick off the scan on OS X. Turns out it's quite easy:

  * Open the OS X Preview app
  * Go to the File menu and select Import From Scanner
  * Select your printer
  * Look for the "Format" option on the right hand page and set it to PDF
  * Select the "Create single document" option
  * Hit the Scan button

This will produce a single PDF file with all of the pages of your document, scanned into the location of your choice.
