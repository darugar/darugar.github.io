Over the weekend I attended the Blackberry hackathon with the hopes of creating an [Xpenser](/web/20120918052602/http://xpenser.com/) blackberry app. The RIM folks were nice enough to give away a Playbook to everyone who presented, so I ended up with one.

I was skeptical, to say the least. I expected a sluggish, ugly interface with a dearth of applications.

What I got is quite nice. The blackberry has a very usable interface - it's fast and responsive, and some of the gestures \(eg. closing and switching apps\) are the best I've seen on a tablet.

It comes with a nice car racing game \(I surprised myself by spending a few hours playing it\), and the browser is quite excellent, probably the best I've seen on a tablet.

The development environment is also rich: you can use HTML or flash as well as native SDKs.

It doesn't seem to come with a built-in email app \(or if it does I've missed it\), which is very surprising given the Blackberry pedigree.

It's also lacking apps and games - the app world feels a bit empty.

I'm surprised at how much I like the device. I just wish it had more apps.
