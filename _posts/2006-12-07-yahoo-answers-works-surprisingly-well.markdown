I tried [Yahoo Answers](/web/20101222042556/http://answers.yahoo.com/) when it first came out \(I'm a Yahoo employee so I got a sneak preview\). Interesting concept, I thought, let's see how it turns out.

I checked it out every once in a while and wasn't impressed - the questions are generally junk and the answers aren't much better.

Tonight I was trying to figure out [what kind of game console I should buy for the boys](/web/20101222042556/http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ajf206Pzz90ROGwXLY0RPWjsy6IX?qid=20061207171401AAL6WKb) \(since the Wii is sold out everywhere\). I don't know much about game consoles so I sent email to friends and family for advice.

Then it occurred to me to try out the question on Yahoo Answers. The results were surprising. Within 30 minutes I had received 9 answers, 7 of which are actually helpful.

Since that worked so well I decided to ask another question that came to mind about [chemistry and physics experiments that can be done with household items](/web/20101222042556/http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjiEubHR0OpAA7t84Yrj4.jsy6IX?qid=20061207173846AAzMP4s). That one is also generating interesting answers.

And now that I've received value from the community, I feel like I should give back and answer somebody else's question.

Interesting system. Particularly impressive is how fast you get feedback - the first 6 answers came within 10 minutes of posting the question. The speed makes a real difference in the user experience.

One obvious improvement would be to put a link to questions you've asked somewhere more accessible - it's a pain to find your questions right now.
