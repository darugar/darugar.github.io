As I waste yet another styrofoam cup and stare at a desk full of various thank you / congratulations / etc [chachkis](/web/20101222043227/http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=chachki), it occurs to me that if I was handed a real cup / mug instead of the various junk I currently get I could stop wasting styrofoam. A cup is useful, long lasting, and a good place to put your message / logo. 

No more nerf cellphone holder chairs please.
