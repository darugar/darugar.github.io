The [Chrome download](http://google.com/chrome) was surprisingly fast \(as in, less than 5 seconds\). FireFox options import during install didn't work, but it's been smooth sailing since then. It's snappy and so far not buggy. Aesthetics of rendering web pages is good, seems better than FireFox. Quite fast too.

I remember thinking the Konqueror guys were crazy for writing yet another HTML renedering engine. That turned into WebKit, and now it's in Safari, the iPhone, and Chrome. Amazing.
