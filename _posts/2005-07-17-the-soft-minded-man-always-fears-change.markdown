I shaved my head yesterday. People always ask why when I do something like that. Mostly because I'm an idiot, but also because of something Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said:

> The soft-minded man always fears change. He feels security in the status quo, and he has an almost morbid fear of the new. For him, the greatest pain is the pain of a new idea.

I'm fearful that I'm the soft-minded man, so I try to force external, phyiscal change to trigger and clear the way for internal, meaningful change.
