This is an excellent development - [The Big Picture](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/) from boston.com, a beautiful photo blog and one of the big reasons for putting ReaderScroll together, has [implemented j/k navigation, inspired by ReaderScroll](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/10/a_quick_note_1.html). Nicely done - now you can navigate the pictures via the j/k keys.

One down, many more to go. First step towards [j/k navigation everywhere](/say/index.php/2006/12/08/google-reader-interface-everywhere.html).

Btw, several people have pointed out vi used j/k navigation before Google Reader. True enough. j/k was also used in very old keyboard based games. However, the use of j/k to center web content was first brought to my attention in Google Reader, so I'm sticking with "Google Reader Style" instead of "vi style".
