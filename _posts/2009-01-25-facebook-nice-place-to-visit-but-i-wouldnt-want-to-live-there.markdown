Yet another [Scoble post on a facebook accounts being closed](http://scobleizer.com/2009/01/24/facebook-kicks-off-ifart-author-for-having-too-many-friends/), this time with the iFart app author.

Facebook is like Disney Land. It's a nice and enjoyable place, but it has its own special governance. It can decide when to let you in and when to throw you out.

It's a great place to visit, but I wouldn't want to build my house there. Not when the lease can be revoked at any time.

**All my data is belong to me**. It makes no sense to put a third party in control of it. My photos: mine. My writings: mine. Why would I hand them over to a third party?

I can understand the appeal of easy publishing to the general public - Facebook truly makes it easy for people to establish a presence and communicate. But for the more technically savvy, Facebook should be treated as a copy, not as the source. Data should be originated and owned elsewhere and channeled into Facebook. Write in your own blog. Post photos onto Flickr, with a local and web backup strategy. Funnel them into Facebook.

That's a bit more like FriendFeed, which may be [why Scoble likes it so much](http://scobleizer.com/2008/12/08/10-reasons-why-twitter-is-for-you-and-friendfeed-is-not/).
