Is it me or does Palin struggle to say "nookiller" instead of nuclear? It seems like she knows the correct pronunciation but goes out of her way to say it incorrectly. Some sort of Bushism or republicanism maybe?

Actually it'd be interesting to draw party lines along pronunciation. I say potato, you say potAto.
