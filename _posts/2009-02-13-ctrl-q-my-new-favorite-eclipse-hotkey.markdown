Due to [aforementioned OS X stupidity](/say/index.php/2009/02/13/did-i-mention-i-hate-the-mac.html) with the Home and End keys, my new favorite Eclipse hotkey is Ctrl-Q. It takes you to the location of your last edit. So next time you hit the End key to go to the end of the line but end up at the end of the file and curse Jobs and his cult, remember to hit Ctrl-Q to go back to where you should be.
