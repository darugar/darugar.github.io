I'm a big fan of [Fantastic Mr. Fox](/web/20121118030007/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0432283/). We just watched it again and it was a hit with everyone from the 2 year old to grandma. 

The dialog an voice acting are excellent, and the animation is really refreshing. The story is smart and is different enough from your typical Disney fare to be a welcome change. 

I recommend it, go see it.
