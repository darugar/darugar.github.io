After 2 days of pain, finally a hackintosh is born. My advice to you if you're thinking of setting up a hackintosh: don't. Go buy a cheap mac instead.

As I was fond of saying in the old days: Linux is free if your time is worthless. Hackintosh is about the same.

Having said that, I can confirm OS X 10.5.6 runs on a Toshiba A135-S4467 with most things working, with the exception of: sleep and wifi \(so far\). Things that do work: wired ethernet, USB, both external keyboard/mouse \(with USB\) and internal laptop keyboard/mouse, sound, and dual boot with Vista.

I'll probably post the painful details at some point. In the meanwhile, I'm back on the mac. The things one does for the sake of the iPhoneâ€¦
