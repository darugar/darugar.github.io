Here's a lazyweb question for you: what's the best way to convert my flickr photo stream into facebook albums on an automated, continual basis? I much prefer dealing with flickr than facebook for photos, but many of my lazy friends are on facebook, keep asking for photos, but are apparently unable to click over to flickr or subscribe to the RSS feed.

There should be an easy way to have my photos automagically show up in facebook, right? I tried the top 2 flickr apps in facebook but they don't seem to do this.
