The boys \(4 and 5 years old\) got the [Shrek the Third](http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FActivision-ACTI9-Shrek-The-Third%2Fdp%2FB000NJFMG0%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dvideogames%26qid%3D1201065635%26sr%3D8-1&tag=parandcom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=parandcom-20&l=ur2&o=1) game for the Wii a month or two ago and have been enjoying it since. It's a great game for young gamers; the controls are easy and the game is very playable. It doesn't throw artificial frustrating roadblocks in the way, opting instead to let them play through and reach far into the game. I'd definitely recommend it for younger players.
