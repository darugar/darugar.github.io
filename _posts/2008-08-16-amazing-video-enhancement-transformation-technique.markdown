[This](/web/20101222052143/http://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/videoenhancement/videoEnhancement.htm) is just incredible. The effects are amazing, but I'm guessing the models and tools behind what they do are going to fundamentally change the way we use video. Apparently these guys are divining a pretty good depth and color projection map from videos and photographs. With that you've added entirely new dimensions to the readily available information conveyed by video, opening the door to a huge range of effects and enhancements. Looking forward to seeing more of this.
