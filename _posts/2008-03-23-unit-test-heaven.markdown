Let me just say: unit tests are an amazing god-send. If you're not using them you are missing a tremendous amount. Beyond the obvious, the freedom and confidence it gives you to re-work your code makes it feasible to actually go back, clean up, and create better code. I'm enjoying this at this very moment \(yes, programming on a beautiful Sunday morning instead of enjoying the world\).
