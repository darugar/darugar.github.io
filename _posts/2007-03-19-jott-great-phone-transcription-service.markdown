I started using [Jott](/web/20101222044547/http://jott.com/) this morning and so far I like it. It's a simple service - you call a toll free number, record a 15 second message, Jott transcribes it, and sends it to you in email as both an audio and a text file.

I thought it might be a useless service, but I've already used it twice this morning. Surprisingly the transcription worked in both cases. I like the fact that they send you the audio file as well. The transcription takes a while \(maybe 15 minutes or so\), but that might be because they've gotten a fair bit of coverage over the weekend and the service is overloaded.

I'm looking forward to seeing what APIs and integration services these guys end up offering. Could be a simple alternative to [VoiceXML](/web/20101222044547/http://www.w3.org/TR/voicexml20/) and services like [TellMe](/web/20101222044547/http://tellme.com/).
