A friend forwarded me an email about yet another group using a database to implement what's really a queue. Not surprisingly, performance is an issue.

Queues are still not part of the average developer's standard set of tools. At least the Java world has a standard API and several good implementations to pick from. The scripting world is a hodge-podge, and I still haven't found a great choice despite a good bit of looking.

I'm looking forward to a simple, commonly used queue interface / implementation that people can wrap their heads around and employ widely. Use of queues is one of the basic techniques for achieving scale, and we're still lacking the basic tools to use it.
