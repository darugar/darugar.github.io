[Jaime Lerner's Ted Talk](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/213) on sustainable cities is pretty funny. A couple of choice quotes:

> A City is like a family portrait - we don't rip our photo even if we don't like the nose of our uncle.

> Creativity starts when you cut a zero from your budget. If you cut two it's even better.

> Cars are like your mother-in-law. You have to maintain a good relationship with them, but if they're the only woman in your life you're in trouble.
