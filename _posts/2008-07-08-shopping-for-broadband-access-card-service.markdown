I just cancelled my Verizon broadband account, mainly because the card was no longer working in my PC and the mac doesn't take PC cards. I was surprised at how little effort Verizon put in to keeping me; I've been paying the $80 per month for almost 2 years now, and they let me go without giving me much incentive to stay.

I'm hoping the new 3G iPhone will be able to act as a modem; I could possibly stomach paying the outrageous monthly fees if it replaces my extra broadband card. I'm pretty sure it'll be able to, through legitimate or hacked means, shortly after release.

Anyway, I do need wireless broadband service, so I'm going to get a new card and service. If you have a card / cell phone / service you use let me know what you like and dislike about it.
