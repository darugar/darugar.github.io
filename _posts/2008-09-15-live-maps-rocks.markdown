Live doesn't get a lot of love and with those new ads Microsoft needs some serious help getting the word out, so let me say something nice about them. I've been using Live Maps lately, mainly because of the "Bird's eye view", and it's quickly becoming my favourite map app. If you have't tried it give it a shot: <http://maps.live.com/> . I'm guessing you'll like it.
