I frequently run into pages with loads of images \([here's one](/web/20101222052122/http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2008/08/beijing_2008_its_a_wrap.html) via [Kedrosky](/web/20101222052122/http://paul.kedrosky.com/archives/2008/08/25/linkfest_olympi.html), [here's](/web/20101222052122/http://stuff.thdesign.be/forum/varia/OS.html) another, and here's [yet another](/web/20101222052122/http://headinjurytheater.com/abcexcuse.htm)\). Viewing these images involves a dance of scrolling or hitting space, then scrolling again to get the image lined up in the viewable part of the browser, and repeating over and over again.

The better user experience would be to have Google Reader style hotkeys that bring each picture into view, lining it up properly for easy viewing. You'd be able to hit "j" after viewing each picture to see the next. No more messing with the scrollbars.

I'm guessing a greasemonkey script to enable this with any page would be pretty straight forward to do. Anybody know if it already exists? If not, someone should do it.
