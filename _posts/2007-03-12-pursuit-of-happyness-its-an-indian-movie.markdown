Watched Pursuit of Happyness the other night. My wife summed it up beautifully: it's an Indian movie. That is: it's a monotone of bad, sad, down-on-your-luck, with a final redemeption.

This could've been a much better movie if they didn't maintain the monotone. Throw in a couple of ups and downs. Have a twist or a curve.

Not a terrible movie, not a great movie.
