I revived a bunch of mp3 onto my windows box. I want to get them onto my iPhone. Should be drop-dead simple.

I've spent 10 minutes with iTunes, pressed the "Sync" button a ridiculous number of times, and I'm no closer to getting the songs onto the iPhone.

I found an article that suggested creating a special playlist and sync'ing that with the iPhone. Fine. However, when I try to sync that it tells me my iPhone is already sync'd with another computer \(the infamous mac\) and that sync'ing would erase the existing songs on there.

Why on earth is this difficult? Did apple really assume you'd only ever want to transfer songs from a single computer?

I'm really puzzled and disgusted. I should be able to drag and drop my songs onto the iPhone and magic should happen. Bah.
