Mozilla announces [TraceMonkey](/web/20101222052023/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2008/08/tracemonkey_javascript_lightsp.html), a [just-in-time compiler for Javascript](/web/20101222052023/http://ejohn.org/blog/tracemonkey/). If you've watched [Steve Yegge's talk on Dynamic Languages](/web/20101222052023/http://stanford-online.stanford.edu/courses/ee380/080507-ee380-300.asx) \([transcript](/web/20101222052023/http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2008/05/dynamic-languages-strike-back.html)\) you've already had a taste of what the future could look like for dynamic languages - namely, performance on par with today's low level languages.

Javascript started as an ugly language but has been steadily [shedding its bad parts](/web/20101222052023/http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FJavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford%2Fdp%2F0596517742%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Dbooks%26qid%3D1219472734%26sr%3D8-1&tag=parandcom-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325)![](/web/20101222052023im_/http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=parandcom-20&l=ur2&o=1) and adopting a [beautiful functional style](/web/20101222052023/http://jquery.com/). With the performance piece figured out and a tremendously large number of installations and runtimes \(just about every browser in existence has a Javascript engine\), it could become the most important programming language of the near future.
