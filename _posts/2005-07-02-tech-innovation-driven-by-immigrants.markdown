Ross Mayfield, in a post on [Estonia](http://ross.typepad.com/blog/2005/06/open_estonia.html), casually mentions:

> in Silicon Valley 70% of CEOs are first generation immigrants

That's a fascinating stat. First generation immigrants are incredible people, but this is fairly outrageous. I wonder what the stat for new businesses in general is.
