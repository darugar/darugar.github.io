Wife is in Florida with the youngest kid, and the other two spent most of the weekend at my parents', giving me a chance to engage in plenty of bad habits. Mostly work and sleep.

It's an amazing feeling to wake up after more than 8 hours of sleep. Really quite fantastic. It's obvious with the kids - if they don't get enough sleep they're cranky and lethargic. The same is at work with adults, we're just better able to mask it.

Anyway: sleep. I highly recommend it.
