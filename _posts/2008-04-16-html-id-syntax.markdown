From [W3C HTML Recommendation](http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-name):

> ID and NAME tokens must begin with a letter \(\[A-Za-z\]\) and may be followed by any number of letters, digits \(\[0-9\]\), hyphens \("-"\), underscores \("\_"\), colons \(":"\), and periods \("."\).

\(Noting here because I always forget and have to look this up\)
