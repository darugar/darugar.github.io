Mike Verdon's [Python Twitter Tools](http://mike.verdone.ca/twitter/) is less popular and findable than the Dewitt Clinton's [python-twitter](http://code.google.com/p/python-twitter/) \(I only found the former from an email on the latter's mailing list\), but it's a beautiful library. 125 lines, most of which are comments. It implements the full API by implementing a single call class that handles everything \(and that class is only a few lines\). A good library to use if you're trying to access Twitter via Python, and a good source for learning and inspiration if you're writing a library / wrapper.
