John Resig's post on [JavaScript Engine Speeds](/web/20101222051730/http://ejohn.org/blog/javascript-engine-speeds/) got me thinking - there are a lot of solid implementations of the JavaScript language specification. Is JavaScript the language with the most implementations? Are there any other languages that have as many runtimes or as many implementations of the language specification?
