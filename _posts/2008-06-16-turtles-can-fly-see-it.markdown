![Turtles Can Fly](/web/20101222043423im_/http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMTI5NDM2NzcwOF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTcwNTI2MDgyMQ@@._V1._SX194_SY288_.jpg)

We watched [Turtles Can Fly](/web/20101222043423/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0424227/) tonight. The story of Iraqi-Kurdish refugee children before, during, and just after the US invasion.

The movie is harsh. The life, the sheer numbers, and what they have to do to get by is just harsh.

The movie is well done; it's not preachy and doesn't dwell on the negatives. But it's hard to watch at times.

Well worth seeing, give it a look.
