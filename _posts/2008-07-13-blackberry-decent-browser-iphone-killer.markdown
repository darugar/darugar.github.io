I'm a bit of an iPhone fanboy, it's true. However, [Fred Wilson's post on mobile apps](/web/20101222045935/http://avc.blogs.com/a_vc/2008/07/thinking-abou-2.html) has me thinking - the main reason I carry an iPhone as well as a BlackBerry is the iPhone's browser. The rest of the stuff is great, but the killer app is the browser.

And the BlackBerry has its own advantages. It's much easier to type on, for example. The camera quality is also better as Fred points out.

Generally speaking, the BlackBerry is a very nice device. It's just not usable as a Web browser. If BB figured out how to put a real browser on there that matched the iPhone's quality and usability, for all my fanboy enthusiasm, I'd probalby go back to carrying a single cell phone instead of both the BB and the iPhone.
