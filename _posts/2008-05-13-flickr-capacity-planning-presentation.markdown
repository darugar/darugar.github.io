Unfortunately I missed the Web2.0 Expo this year, but I've been catching up on slides and presentations. I had [John Allspaw's Capacity Planning For Web Operations](/web/20101222040552/http://www.slideshare.net/jallspaw/capacity-planning-for-web-operations-web20-expo-2008) open in a tab for several days and finally got to it. Turned out to be much more interesting than I'd anticipated. Slide 9 - "Normal" growth: 4x increase in photo requests/sec. That's pretty obscene. Slide 43 - diagonal scaling: replacing 67 dual core servers with 18 dual quads results in ~half the load per server. Slide 45: ~70% less power usage, 49U less space. I'd been curious about that last stat \(power usage of horizontally scaled servers versus multitude of smaller servers\), good to see some real numbers for it.
