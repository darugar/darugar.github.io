There was a [massive collision](/web/20101222033743/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080321-1304-bn21drifting.html) this morning blocking off the main road connecting our neighbourhood to the rest of the world. We were all trapped in our little parcel of the world, unable to get to school, work, etc.

This was not happy occasion by any stretch, but it did result in all the neighbours walking around, chatting, discussing, etc. Quite an odd scene to see so many of us walking instead of jumping into cars and racing away. Really quite a nice feel to it actually - greeting your neighbours, enjoying the morning sun, etc.

I'm going to make an attempt to walk the neighbourhood more - no need to wait for such morbid events to get me out of the house / office / car.
