Ran across [Brendan Eich's popularity post](/web/20101221232740/http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2008/04/popularity.html) via [Ajaxian](/web/20101221232740/http://ajaxian.com/archives/popularity-history-and-script-shared). Besides the interesting history lesson \(which, btw, is quite interesting\), I was struck by the quality of writing. It's rare to see such quality and care in blog posts. I was immediately motivated to subscribe \(although I didn't because it looks like he posts about once a quarter\).

Anyway, if you blog, take a moment to write good.
