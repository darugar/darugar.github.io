I randomly picked up a collection of shorts by Vladimir Nabokov, [this one](/web/20120202173908/http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=parandcom-20&path=tg/detail/-/0679729976/qid=1112517980/sr=8-1/ref=pd_csp_1?v=glance&s=books&n=507846). Just as randomly I selected a story, "A Russian Beauty".

This is one the most amazing shorts I've ever read. It's really quite incredible; it paints a rich, vivid picture of this lady's life in just a few pages. It distills the salient points of a life to a few moments, all the while capturing the mood of every stage. 

If at all you get a chance, read this one. Ten minutes of your life to immerse yourself in real beauty. I haven't had as much luck with the other stories; they're very good, but no match for A Russian Beauty.
