The blog was down due to power being shut down \(because of the fires\) for a while. The server was back on but not responding. Turns out I still had the Ubuntu 5 CD in the drive from when I installed it\! Impressive that it'd been running that long without a reboot.

The house looks ok, no damage and not too much ash. The air quality is not great, we're heading back out, this time to my dad's.
