[Drizzle](/web/20101222041545/http://drizzle.wikia.com/wiki/Drizzle_Wiki) is interesting:

> Drizzle: A High-Performance Microkernel DBMS for Scale-Out Applications  
Drizzle is a community-driven project based on the popular MySQL DBMS that is focused on MySQL's original goals of ease-of-use, reliability and performance.

Headed up by [Brian Aker](/web/20101222041545/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Aker), Director of Architecture at MySQL AB. Take a look at the [MySQL Differences](/web/20101222041545/http://drizzle.wikia.com/wiki/MySQL_Differences) page and you'll mostly see features _removed_ and cleaned up, which is great. Designed for high levels of concurrency, targeted to "cloud" applications. [Monty](/web/20101222041545/http://monty-says.blogspot.com/2008/07/what-if.html) and [Brian's](/web/20101222041545/http://krow.livejournal.com/602409.html) posts offer motivation for the project.

Something to keep an eye on.
