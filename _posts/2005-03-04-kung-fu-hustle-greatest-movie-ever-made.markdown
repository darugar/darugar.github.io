I just saw [Kung Fu Hustle](http://www.sonypictures.com/intl/cn/kungfuhustle/site/) . **This is quite possibly the best movie ever made. **

Ok, so maybe I exaggerate a little. But this is an excellent movie. Laugh out loud funny, and I'm not much of a laugher. Btw, [Wachowski brothers](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0905152/), this is how a fight scene with one guy against a thousand is done.

Highly recommended. Go see [Kung Fu Hustle](http://technorati.com/tag/Kung+Fu+Hustle). I give it 9 out of 10. Now I'll have to go see [Shaolin Soccer](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0286112/) I guessâ€¦
