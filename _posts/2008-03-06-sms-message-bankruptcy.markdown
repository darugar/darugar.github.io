It was hip a while back to declare email bankruptcy and admit being hopelessly over-run by your inbox. I'm taking it one step further - I'm now SMS message bankrupt also. At this moment I have 613 unread SMS messages, most of which are various email and calendar alerts, and some of which are undoubtedly important messages from you. My ancient little nokia has no chance of dealing with this many messages - in fact "delete all SMS messages" doesn't even work. So if you've sent me an SMS message and I haven't replied, I'm sorry, I'm incompetent.
