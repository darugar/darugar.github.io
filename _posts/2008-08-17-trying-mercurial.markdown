All the cool kids are into Git these days and I've been reading plenty of articles about how good it is and how to use it. The problem is, I don't really have a problem with Subversion. I know I should, because all the cool kids do, but I just don't run into a lot of issues with it. In the absence of a problem to solve it would simply be peer-pressure to give Git a shot.

So in an attempt to remain [ever-so-independent](/web/20101222051957/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qANMjwLmo6Y) I'm going to try a distributed system, but not Git. I'm going with [Mercurial](/web/20101222051957/http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/wiki/).

Actually mainly it's because Mercurial seems significantly simpler, and I'm a simple guy. It's also written in Python, which gives me a warm and fuzzy. And I'm finally motivated to try it because I'm going to try a code path which may not work out, and I understand these distributed systems deal with that well.

Hmm. The main thing I'd want from a source code control system would be a bit of packaging and deployment intelligence built in. Maybe something to minify and join my javascript files and mend the files that reference them. I'm extremely pleased not to have a "make" step anywhere in my process, but I do miss some of the capabilities.

If I'm making a mistake and I should go with Git, or perhaps CVS, do let me know.
