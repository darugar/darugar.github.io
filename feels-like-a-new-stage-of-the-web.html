            <p>I was doing some log analysis this morning and was struck by the variety of user agents accessing <a href="http://xpenser.com/">Xpenser</a>. Quite a bit of mobile access with quite a variety of different browsers, as well as some more exotic items (various tablet PCs I don't recognize, etc). </p>
<p>Then there's the API access that's been picking up quite significantly - in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if it overtakes regular web access in a little while.</p>
<p>For quite a while the web we had a fairly uniform set of entry points - IE and FireFox for the most part, with a smattering of others thrown in. There is so much more variety now, and the variety is significant - for example, the difference between a mobile device and a desktop browser is much more significant than between IE and FF.</p>
<p>I'm hoping other modes of access become commonplace as well - boxee, tablet PCs, etc.</p>
<p>It feels like we're at a transition point from uniformity to diversity again. This will mean pain the short term as we adjust, but a richer and more encompassing experience once we make it to the other side. </p>
<p>I'm looking forward to it.</p>
